# hubploy-template

This repo is a template for deploying a locally defined Helm chart with
[hubploy](https://github.com/yuvipanda/hubploy). This template repository
contains the basic file and folder setup that Hubploy expects. The local Helm
chart depends on JupyterHub by default and is a good place to add some custom
Kubernetes resources.
